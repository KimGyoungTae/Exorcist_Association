Thank you for downloading this music pack! I hope it will serve you well with whatever project you are currently working on. This free music pack contains 6 loopable songs of fantasy/medieval harp music. It's calm and a bit nostalgic atmosphere will fit best with your 2D RPGs and indie exploration games.

You don't have to give me a credit for using this music pack. However definitely let me know about your game using my music so I can check it out and share it with my audience.

If you have any questions, requests or you want me to compose music for your project, you can contact me at: contact@mythagomusic.com
